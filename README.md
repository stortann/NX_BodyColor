# NX_BodyColor
Macro in NX so I don't have to look up the values of some colors anymore

## Funcionality
Journal desciption:<br />
1/ Changes session's settings to Part Shininess<br />
2/ Sets Background to Plain White (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)<br />
3/ Changes all of the lights to 0.0 except "Ambient" which will be 1.0<br />
4/ Turns off Shaded Edges<br />
5/ Hides everything that is not a body<br />
6/ Changes colors of bodies according to a specific rule: bodies that have one of the following colors {186, 6, 211, 31} will be colored according to the index from the first array in this array - {1, 159, 201, 210}, otherwise the color will not be changed<br />
